Google Analytics employs cookies that are stored to your computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site. The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our Website, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google‚Äôs location in the US and stored there.</p>
                      <p>In using Google Analytics our Website employs the extension ‚ÄúanonymizeIp‚Äù. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address. Google uses this information to analyze your use of our Website, to compile reports for us on internet activity and to provide other services relating to our Website. You may learn more about Google‚Äôs IP anonymization at the following link: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en" class="heading-style-h2-2" style = "font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: none; font-size: 12.5px !important;">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en</a>¬†</p>

                      <p>Google Analytics also offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access. The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics not to transmit any information about website visits to Google Analytics. However, the browser deactivation add-on offered by Google Analytics does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analysis services we may engage.</p>
                      <p>Google Analytics also uses electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Website are used.</p>
